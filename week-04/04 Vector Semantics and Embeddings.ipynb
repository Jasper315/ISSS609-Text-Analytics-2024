    "# Exercise #4.1: Building a Demo Text Retrieval System Using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn to use Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF techniques to vectorize text and retrieve similar sentences using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Text retrieval systems are fundamental in various applications, such as search engines and recommendation systems. In this exercise, you will implement a demo text retrieval system by representing sentence queries as vectors using both a Bag-of-Words and a TF-IDF model. The goal is to understand how different vector representations affect the quality of similar sentence retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bag of Words Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenize and preprocess the provided corpus of sentences.\n",
    "- Construct a Bag-of-Words model that converts each sentence into a vector based on word frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF-IDF Representation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Build a TF-IDF model using the tokenized corpus.\n",
    "- Convert each sentence into a TF-IDF vector, which reflects not just the frequency but also the importance of each word in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence Querying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Randomly select a sentence from the corpus to use as the query.\n",
    "- Convert this query into both Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectors.\n",
    "- Retrieve and display the top 5 similar sentences from the corpus for each representation using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to use the `politeness.tsv` corpus, which was downloaded in **week-02**, for text retrieval. Therefore, you need to move this data into the designated directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Necessary libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "You may need to use sklearn libraries for cosine similarity calculations. To install sklearn, you can run the following command:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install scikit-learn\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter the following problem:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "TypeError: Cannot convert numpy.ndarray to numpy.ndarray\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can resolve it by running:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "pip install pandas==2.1.4\n",
    "```\n"
